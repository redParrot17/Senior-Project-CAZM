Here are some instructions on setting up Flask ~ Zack
-----------------------------------------------------

1. In the Command Line, navigate to the project directory
2. If on a Unix System, run the following code:

	source env/bin/activate

   If on a Windows System, run the following code:

	env\Scripts\activate

   This will switch your Python3 Environment to the Virtual Environment in the 'env' folder rather than your default

3.  UNIX

	export FLASK_APP=server.py

    Windows

    	set FLASK_APP=server.py

    This tells the server the arbitrary name of the main Flask server file (server.py in this case)

4.	flask run

    This will start the flask server! It can be accessed by going to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser. Feel Free to message me with your flask questions! :)
